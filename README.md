# Mousetile

###### A tiling window manager inside Gnome Shell, for people who like using
mice.

## Installation

This repository is a gnome shell extension. To install locally:

    $ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
    $ cd !$
    $ git clone https://github.com/justjake/mousetile-gnome.git
mousetile@jake.teton-landis.org

Then, to activate the extension, point `Firefox` or any browser with
the Gnome-Shell plugin installed to the [installed extensions
page](https://extensions.gnome.org/local/), and turn the **Mousetile**
extension on.

## Intended Behavior

Your shell should behave like the panel layout UI of Visual Studio
2012. If it doesn't, that's because there's no code here, yet.

## Name

Please suggest a new one.

Because I'm bad at names and `gnome-shell-extension-tool` really wanted
one
